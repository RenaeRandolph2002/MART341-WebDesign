Q: How did your user testing sessions go?
A: I believe that my user testing sessions went quite well. My sister and coworker gave many compliments such as the color scheme, images, and layout of my web pages. This made me feel reassured of my choices and the content I have added. The only element they were confused about was the buttons that didnâ€™t do anything such as my order now button on the home page and the menu items. 


Q: What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received?
A: A piece of feedback I implemented was from my sister. She suggested I add more menu items to better flesh out my menu page. I followed her advice and added two more columns displaying food items, such as cupcakes, donuts, and croissants. I really like how my menu looks now.
