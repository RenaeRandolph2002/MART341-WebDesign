Q: Describe the difference between semantic and structural markup.

Semantic markup is used to visualize the meaning of the information. By highlighting, bolding, italicizing, underlining, and others. You can emphasize the words and information you are putting into your code/website. Structural markup is used to form the structure of the document. Such as headings, lists, paragraphs, breaks, and more. Using these elements organizes your information to help the viewer navigate it.
