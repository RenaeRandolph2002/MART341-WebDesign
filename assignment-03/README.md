Three things I have learned: 

1. I have learned the internet is made up of wires that use binary code to transfer information. To have internet across contents there is a network of wires under the ocean. 

2. Web directors are a type of folder used in web building that helps keep websites organized and are vital when making websites run. As the computers use that system to go from point A to point B and where to place elements. 

3. I have begun learning the many different types of file categories, and how important it is to label files. Such as TXT, JPG, PNG, MD, and more.
