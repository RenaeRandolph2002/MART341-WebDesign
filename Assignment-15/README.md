Q: What is the goal of your website? 
A: I decided to make a website for a coffee shop. The goal of my website is to market the website and give viewers clear access to information. I plan to have a home page, an about page, a contact page, and a page for the menu. I will add large buttons to clearly guide people to the information they desire. I hope to produce a straightforward and well-organized website.
