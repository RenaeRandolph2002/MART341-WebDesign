Q: Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?
A: Everything about HTML is new to me. Before this class, I had never viewed code let alone made my own. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I have enjoyed exploring this new medium. I find coding in HTML to be enjoyable. To write out code and watch my website develop into something cool looking. I never pictured myself pursuing this field, but it's good to know that I actually can see myself continuing to work with HTML. 
Q: After we come back from spring break we will start to dive into CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?
A: My focus is on design work so being able to expand on decorating our websites sounds awesome. I think my favorite part of coding is adding colors, it goes from a blank canvas to a professional-looking website. I think color has so much power and look forward to continuing to learn new ways to enhance our assignments.
